# InvernessSoccer
A UX redesign for the Inverness Soccer Website. Late summer 2019, I was asked if I could redo the website for inverness soccer club (https://www.invernesssoccer.com/). 

I used the Bootstap sticky footer navbar css classes for the layout (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sticky-footer-navbar/). 
It needed to be easy to update, without touching any html, so I used php to read in text files. 

I worked on and off of the website during the school year, and during the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine, I was able to finish it some more. As of 5/6/2020, it is not finished. 

Here is an update I made for the commissioner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57PRiHV1oGk
