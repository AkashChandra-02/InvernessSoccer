<dd>Many of the Inverness residents pay into other park districts such as Palatine or Barrington Park District. The resident rate is for only residents whose taxes are allocated to Inverness Park District. Check your tax bill to see which park district is receiving payment from your taxes or visit the registration page for a list of streets that are part of Inverness Park District.</dd>

<dd>Yes,  there is a spot on the registration form to request a friend.  
These requests will be considered if you register prior to teams being formed.  
Late registration friend requests may not be honored. 
We try to balance teams by age and gender.  
Some friends may be separated to make the teams more balanced.</dd>

<li>I am interested in coaching, what do I need to do to be considered as a coach?</li>
