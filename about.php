	<h1>About Inverness Soccer Club</h1>
Inverness Soccer Club is a recreational/instructional fall soccer league that is dedicated to providing a positive sports experience for our participants, regardless of ability, that is enjoyable and rewarding, develops character while having fun and building friendships. <br><br>Today we have around 360 players in our league which consists of players from Pre-K through 8th grade and all of our teams are co-ed.  Early bird registration for the fall season begins in April, and are only done though the link at the top of this page.  Teams practice once a week beginning in early August with games on occurring on Saturdays through the middle of October.  Through our partnership with the local soccer community we’re able to have the last game indoors which is very fun and exciting for the kids.  Being a recreational league with enjoyment and instruction as the primary goals,  teams are organized taking into account not only school affiliation but also friend requests (the latter is unique to Inverness Soccer Club).

ISC not only serves the Inverness area but also has participants that travel from Palatine, Hoffman Estates, Lake Zurich, Rolling Meadows, Kildeer, Barrington and Long Grove.  Our league is managed by volunteers from our board, our commissioners to our parent coaches.  Many of the participants that have graduated from our soccer program come back to serve our league as coaches or referees.  We are able to keep our registration fees low because of the support we receive from our local businesses and families.   Many of our teams are sponsored by businesses owned by the parents of our participants.   

<br><br>Since we are founded by residents, we try to stay active in the community.  We host a food drive for Holy Family Church's food pantry, collect used equipment to donate to kids in need and look continue to look for other ways to support our neighbors. 
Thank you for visiting our website and register to follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/InvernessSoccerClub/">ISC's Facebook page</a>.<br><br>
<h1>ISC Code of Conduct</h1> 
The Inverness Soccer Club “ISC” is aware of the ever increasing incidents of conflict and violence in youth sport leagues across the country. 
In every instance these conflicts can be traced back to the conduct and character of the coaches and parents. The following code of conduct is expected of all coaches, assistant coaches and parents.

<br><br>1. All coaches are subject to background checks. Based on the results of the background check, league officials have the right to deny application of volunteerism. 
Therefore, the IYSA Disclosure Statement must be completed and filed with ISC prior to the first game.

<br><br>2. As an “ISC” coach your character is constantly being evaluated. 
It is expected that you are a role model for your players, the opposing players and the parents in attendance. 
You will set the tone for what is appropriate. Your demonstration of character and attitude are more important than the soccer skills you teach. 
<br><br>3. As a reminder the ISC is not a “WIN AT ALL COST” League. ISC is a RECREATIONAL/INSTRUCTIONAL League. 
Our primary function is to provide a positive soccer experience for our player’s participants. The core philosophies of the league are:

<br><br>4. IT IS NEVER APPROPRIATE TO DIRECT ANY CRITICISM TOWARDS THE REFEREE. Nor, is it appropriate to vocally question a referee’s call to either the players or those in attendance. 
ISC uses youth referees. Even though they are certified by IYSA they are in a learning process and subject to make procedural and interruptive mistakes. 
It is never appropriate to “engage” a referee during or after the game. Complaints about a specific referee must be submitted in writing to the league referee coordinator or directors. 
Formal game protest will not be enthusiastically entertained. A loss based on a bad call may be the biggest challenge to your character. 
You will be expected to use the experience as a teaching opportunity. Work with the other coach in approaching any problem that may be transpiring during the game.

<br><br>5. At no time should a coach have inappropriate contact with the players. Congratulatory contact should be limited to “high fives” and head pats.
It is never appropriate to grab a player, including efforts to put the player in position.

<br><br>6. Use of profanity in either practice or games mandates an immediate disqualification and possible additional sanctions.

<br><br>7. The referee can disqualify a coach and or parent from a game in progress. 
Any coach or parent disqualified from a game is also subject to additional sanctions of the league directors. 
Any coach/parent disqualified from a game is required to leave Park District property immediately. Failure to so will mean forfeiture of that game plus additional league sanctions.

<br><br>8. Coaches can be held responsible for the conduct of their team’s spectators.

<br><br>9. It is the responsibility of the coach to prohibit any participation in either practice or game until the medical waiver has been signed and returned by player’s parent/guardian.

<br><br>10. Your position as a volunteer coach is subject to termination any time for conduct found to be in violation of the above “CODE OF CONDUCT”. 
Suspension and terminations are at the sole discretion of the league directors.	

<br><br><h1>ISC Mission Statement</h1>

It is the mission of Inverness Soccer Club to foster the development of local youth through the sport of soccer. 
We are dedicated to providing our participants with a fun, high-quality soccer experience that encourages sportsmanship and a love of the game through the development of player, coach, referee and team. 
Inverness Soccer Club is a RECREATIONAL/INSTRUCTIONAL League. Our primary function is to provide a positive soccer experience for our player’s participants.

<br><br><h4>Our program is based on the following concepts:</h4>
<br>
Respect For All Persons:

All of our members are equally important and will be treated with respect and fairness without regard for age, ethnicity, gender or social status.
<br><br>
Player Development:  

Player development within a fun and age-appropriate environment is one of our primary missions. 
Our younger groups are taught primarily individual skills, with less emphasis on tactics or winning. 
Our club employs and will continually refine a set of learning goals for all ages.
<br><br>
Safety:

We will provide a physically and emotionally safe environment for our members.
<br><br>
Coaches:

Coaches play an instrumental part as both teachers and role models.
We offer our volunteer coaches a professional coach’s clinic during our coaches meeting. 
So that there is no misinterpretation or misunderstanding, there is an emphasis on the philosophy of SPORTSMANSHIP superseding all others. 
This applies to all coach’s actions while on Park District property during and after play and as a representative of ISC.
<br><br>
Referees:

Inverness Soccer Club recognizes the importance of qualified referees. 
Officials are provided regular opportunity for education and professional development. 
Input from officials is welcomed by the Board. Players are taught to respect the referees by the example of parents and staff, coaches and board members. 
IT IS NEVER APPROPRIATE TO DIRECT ANY CRITICISM TOWARDS THE REFEREE. Nor, is it appropriate to vocally question a referee’s call to either the players or those in attendance. 
ISC uses youth referees. Even though they are certified by IYSA they are in a learning process and subject to make procedural and interruptive mistakes. 
It is never appropriate to “engage” a referee during or after the game.
<br><br>
Family Involvement:

We believe membership in Inverness Soccer Club is a family affair. 
We rely on our members to volunteer as coaches in order to provide quality programs for our kids. 
We hope that our families will enjoy their membership in our soccer community.
<br><br>
Affiliations:

The development of the game of soccer in our community is best accomplished through our affiliation with larger soccer governing bodies, including the Illinois Youth Soccer Association and the US Youth Soccer.
<br><br>
Governance:

Inverness Soccer Club is governed in a fair, open and inclusive manner. Club business is conducted according to our bylaws by a volunteer board, and by providing numerous opportunities for all members to actively participate.
<br><br>
Conduct:

We endorse the Illinois Youth Soccer Association’s codes of conduct for players, coaches, parents and referees.  
Many controversies could be avoided if we all were good sports in winning as well as in loosing. 
ISC has no team standings and there are no playoffs. There is no benefit in winning big over the other team of players except for our own egos as adults. If the match is uneven, use the opportunity to give some less experienced players a chance to improve their skills.
<br><br>
Good of the Game:

Our goal is not only teaching our players the game of soccer and having fun, but also demonstrating the principles of good sportsmanship and teamwork.  
We hope to nurture a love of the game in the children of our club and enrich the community of ISC. 
We hope the skills and knowledge our members learn will endure, allowing our players to continue to enjoy and participate in this global sport throughout their lives.
